Place your homepage banner image in this folder.

File names supported by the site (first match wins):
- banner-phones.jpg
- banner.jpg

You can also set a custom path in index.html by adding data-src to the banner image:
  <img id="bannerImg" data-src="your/path/to/image.jpg" src="airbuds/a1.jfif" alt="Sale Banner" />

Tip: Use JPG or PNG around 1200–1600px wide for best results. The CSS uses object-fit: cover so most landscape images will look good.
