M-mobilesiles-style prototype

How to view locally:
1. Open `M-mobiles-clone/index.html` in your browser (double-click or Open File).
2. The product images reference images in the parent folder (../mobile, ../airbuds, ../charger). Ensure those folders exist in the project root (they do in this workspace).

What this includes:
- `index.html` — homepage with product grid
- `style.css` — simple modern styles
- `script.js` — product rendering and cart logic

Next steps I can do for you:
- Improve visual styling to match the preview exactly
- Add product detail pages and filters
- Connect to Firestore for dynamic products
- Deploy this to Firebase Hosting (I can handle the deploy)
